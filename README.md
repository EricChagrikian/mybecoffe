As a project to complete for my BeCode Brussels internship: This is an app that simulates some parts of the BeCode website.
Details:
• Contains user registration and login system
• Each day, the user has to mark its arrival time by clicking a button. Same for the departure time
• The user can access a "Talks" page, on which it can schedule talks about a subject of its choice. User can only schedule talks on days that haven't been already picked
